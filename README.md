# keyb â€” Home-row navigation and text selection (AHK on Windows, keyd on Linux)

---

## Why this exists

Provide simple keyboard shortcuts for navigation and text selection without using arrow keys. Inspired by Vim, but works in all apps on both Linux and Windows.

* **CapsLayer/NavMode** for arrows, selection, word/line jumps, and page/document movement.
* Slight Vim influence for keeping hands on the home row.
* Same bindings across both OSes.

---

## Windows

* **AutoHotkey v2** scripts.
* Libraries:

  * `nav_lib.ahk` - movement
  * `text_lib.ahk` - text editing
  * `ui_lib.ahk` - modes/layers, tooltips

## Linux

* Using keyd for low-latency, system-wide remaps.

## Multiplatform

* Planning to use [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)
